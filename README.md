# DBHomekit
Flamigo switches from homewizard (sold by ACTION stores) to control with IFTTT (e.g. Google Assistent)

## Getting started
Download the archive and extract. Upload to your website in a folder name e.g. "home" or copy to your local machine running a webserver

### Prerequisites
- PHP 5.3 or higher
- Curl
- Your credentials used to register with the HomeWizard Lite app that controls your switches (the HomeWizard Lite app itself is not needed)

### Installing
This is pretty straight forward. After copying to your website navigate to the folder you have installed DBHomekit to.
An installation wizard will guide you through the process with a few questions.
1. Asking for a username and password to secure the DBHomekit from access by others.
2. Asking your credentials you used to register the HomeWizard Lite app that controls your switches.
3. DBHomeKit will then make a connection to HomeWizard t6o retrieve all your switch information.
